A React Native module that allows you to use native UI to select a photo/video from the device library or directly from the camera, like so:

#### _Before you open an issue_
This library started as a basic bridge of the native iOS image picker, and I want to keep it that way. As such, functionality beyond what the native `UIImagePickerController` supports will not be supported here. **Multiple image selection, more control over the crop tool, and landscape support** are things missing from the native iOS functionality - **not issues with my library**. If you need these things, [react-native-image-crop-picker](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker) might be a better choice for you.

## Install

`npm install react-native-image-picker@latest --save`

### Automatic Installation

**React Native >= 0.29**
`$react-native link`

**React Native < 0.29**
`$rnpm link`

IMPORTANT NOTE: You'll still need to perform step 4 for iOS and step 3 for Android of the manual instructions below.

### Manual Installation

#### iOS

1. In the XCode's "Project navigator", right click on your project's Libraries folder ➜ `Add Files to <...>`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-image-picker` ➜ `ios` ➜ select `RNImagePicker.xcodeproj`
3. Add `RNImagePicker.a` to `Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries`
4. For iOS 10+, Add the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (if allowing video) keys to your `Info.plist` with strings describing why your app needs these permissions
5. Compile and have fun

#### Android
1. Add the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

    ```gradle
    include ':react-native-image-picker'
    project(':react-native-image-picker').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-image-picker/android')
    ```
2. Add the compile line to the dependencies in `android/app/build.gradle`:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        compile project(':react-native-image-picker')
    }
    ```
3. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    ```
4. Add the import and link the package in `MainApplication.java`:

    ```java
    import com.imagepicker.ImagePickerPackage; // <-- add this import

    public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
        @Override
        protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
            return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
                new MainReactPackage(),
                new ImagePickerPackage() // <-- add this line
            );
        }
    }
```

## Usage

```javascript
var Platform = require('react-native').Platform;
var ImagePicker = require('react-native-image-picker');

// More info on all the options is below in the README...just some common use cases shown here
var options = {
  title: 'Select Avatar',
  customButtons: [
    {name: 'fb', title: 'Choose Photo from Facebook'},
  ],
  storageOptions: {
    skipBackup: true,
    path: 'images'
  }
};

/**
 * The first arg is the options object for customization (it can also be null or omitted for default options),
 * The second arg is the callback which sends object: response (more info below in README)
 */
ImagePicker.showImagePicker(options, (response) => {
  console.log('Response = ', response);

  if (response.didCancel) {
    console.log('User cancelled image picker');
  }
  else if (response.error) {
    console.log('ImagePicker Error: ', response.error);
  }
  else if (response.customButton) {
    console.log('User tapped custom button: ', response.customButton);
  }
  else {
    let source;

    // You can display the image using either data...
    source = {uri: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + response.data, isStatic: true};

    // Or a reference to the platform specific asset location
    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      source = { uri: response.uri };
    } else {
      source = { uri: response.uri.replace('file://', '') };
    }

    this.setState({
      avatarSource: source
    });
  }
});
```
Then later, if you want to display this image in your render() method:
```javascript
<Image source={this.state.avatarSource} style={styles.uploadAvatar} />
```

### Directly Launching the Camera or Image Library

To Launch the Camera or Image Library directly (skipping the alert dialog) you can
do the following:
```javascript
// Launch Camera:
ImagePicker.launchCamera(options, (response)  => {
  // Same code as in above section!
});

// Open Image Library:
ImagePicker.launchImageLibrary(options, (response)  => {
  // Same code as in above section!
});
```


#### Note
On iOS, don't assume that the absolute uri returned will persist. See [#107](/../../issues/107)
